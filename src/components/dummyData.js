One day, however, a young new confectioner in the Imperial kitchen didn’t know the Empress' dislike, and he baked a new cake with honey and thick sour cream. Surprisingly, and unaware of the honey content, Empress Elizabeth immediately fell in love with it.[5] Medovik gained its intense popularity during the Soviet era.[6][7] Today, there are numerous variations of medovik: with condensed milk, buttercream or custard.`;
